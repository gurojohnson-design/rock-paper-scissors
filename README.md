# rock-paper-scissors


Our goal is to write a js only file where we play the game Rock, Paper, Scissors
No GUI yet (which means no interactive interface on the webpage) this will all be done in console.

Sombody's gotta do it. 

Why not me?

New goal!!

We're creating a UI for the player. Going to need buttons instead of a bunch of alerts coming through.
